<p>
    This is a website for tracking shows. It allows you to add, edit, and delete your favorite shows from a single
    platform.
    </br> </br>
    It's primarily meant to help you find the next thing to watch by checking for new seasons. To make sure you can
    always binge watch, it only considers a new season available when all episodes have been released.
    </br></br>
    All the code is open-source so you can even run your own version of this!
